I'm not too serious of a weightlifter, but I dream of one day hitting 3 plates (315 lbs) on bench press!

Here is my current progress:

| Lift          | PR        |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Bench Press   | 245 lbs   |
| Squat         | 285 lbs   |
| Dumbbell Bench Press | 75 lbs per side |
| Dumbbell Incline Bench Press | 75 lbs per side |
| Dumbbell Shoulder Press | 75 lbs per side |

You can probably tell that the Planet Fitness I used to work out at only had dumbbells going up to 75 lbs.
