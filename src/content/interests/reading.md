I love reading! Given the time, I'll devour any book, but my favorite genre has to be science fiction. Here are my favorite books/series of all time:

1. The *Dune* series by Frank Herbert
2. *The Hyperion Cantos* by Dan Simmons
3. *When Breath Becomes Air* by Paul Kalanithi
4. *David Copperfield* by Charles Dickens
